# ExcelDoc_CreateChangeRequest
Python script, reading from an excel document and creates a new document with populated details (In my case a new change request) Run the script in the same directory as the excel document.

Option 1:
Install Python 3
Once installed install openpyxl: "pip install openpyxl"
place both files in the same folder and run the file: "python ChangeRequest.py"

Option 2: 
Or run the .exe with the excel document in the same folder
